# Random-Advice

[Live Code on Heroku](https://pieceofadvice.herokuapp.com/)

Super simple and basic random advice generator made with React and Express, using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/).

NOTE: The *heroku* folder is basically the backend and frontend folders but rearranged for deployment on Heroku.
